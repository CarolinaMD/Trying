# [origin:virus] ORIGIN 
¿What is COVID-19?
It is a new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, finding out by the end of 2019. COVID-19 means “COronaVIrus Disease 2019”.

¿Which is the origin of COVID-19?
Researchers agree that the virus of COVID-19 has an animal based origin, most likely bats.

¿Was the COVID-19 virus made in a laboratory?
No. The stem that the virus was created in a laboratory was discouraged. If COVID-19 virus had been created in a laboratory, its genes would have been known sequences (parts). This is not the case.

¿What does the mutation of COVID-19 mean?
Viruses change or mutate, developing new “variants”, some more so than others. These mutations could change the transmissibility and severity of the disease. 
The COVID-19 virus changes rather slowly compared to influenza virus or HIV. Some variants can affect vaccinated people or who had COVID-19 before, decreasing vaccines effectivity and increasing the reinfection risk.

¿How many COVID-19 virus variants are there?
To date, there have been listed 7 variants of the COVID-19 virus, such as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Iota or Kappa variants.

¿Is the Delta variant more contagious?
Yes. The risk of transmission of the Delta variant is higher.


# [transmission:share] TRANSMISSION 
COVID-19 virus is transmitted through little drops expelled when an infected person breathes, speaks, sings, sneezes or coughs. These invisible drops could be spread around 6 feet (2 meters) and get caught through the eyes, nose, and or mouth of others close to the infected person.

¿Could COVID-19 be spread by touching contaminated things?
Yes. It is possible that a person could get infected by touching contaminated objects (tables or door handles used by an infected person) and then by touching their eyes, nose and mouth without washing their hands previously for at least 20 seconds.

¿Where does the COVID-19 virus spread easily?
The COVID-19 virus is easily transmitted where there are many people together, who do not keep 6 feet of distance for a long period. In closed and stuffy places the spreading is very high.

¿How long could I transmit the COVID-19 virus if I get infected?
The risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus is higher before the onset of the symptoms, 2 previous days. If I have severe COVID-19 I could transmit the coronavirus for longer period.

¿Could asymptomatic people transmit the COVID-19 virus?
Yes. Asymptomatics (infected people who do not develop symptoms in any moment, they appear healthy) could transmit the COVID-19 virus.

¿Could presymptomatic people transmit the COVID-19 virus?
Yes. Presymptomatics (infected people who do not have symptoms yet) could transmit the COVID-19 virus.


¿Does getting infected with the COVID-19 virus mean that I will have the virus in my body forever?
No. Most of the people infected by  COVID-19 virus recover and eliminate the virus. Some people could continue having symptoms months later but it does not mean that they have the virus in their bodies.

¿Could shoes spread the COVID-19 virus?
It is unlikely that the COVID-19 could be spread by shoes. Shoes could be left at the entrance of houses where there are kids playing or crawling on the floor.

¿Could houseflies transmit the COVID-19 virus?
No. To date there isn’t any evidence showing that houseflies could spread the COVID-19 virus.

¿May 5G mobile networks transmit the COVID-19 virus?
No. Viruses cannot be spread through radio waves or mobile networks. Viruses need a cell to stay alive. Places where there isn’t any 5G mobile network, have COVID-19 cases.

¿Could the COVID-19 virus be transmitted by mosquito bites?
No. To date, there isn’t any research showing that mosquito bites could spread the COVID-19 virus.

¿May blood products transmit the COVID-19 virus?
There isn’t any evidence suggesting that the COVID-19 virus could be transmitted through blood products.

¿Can the COVID-19 virus be spread in places with hot and wet weather?
Yes. The COVID-19 virus could be transmitted in any place regardless of the weather, whether it is sunny, hot, wet, dry or cold. Countries with hot weather have COVID-19 cases.

¿May the COVID-19 virus be spread through water?
No. The COVID-19 virus cannot be spread through water whether we are swimming in the sea or pool. Keep at least 1 meter apart from others and wear a mask outside the water.


# [prevention:block] PREVENTION: Vaccines 
## [drugs:pills] Preventive measures
Preventive measures decrease the risk of COVID-19 infection. Wearing or not wearing mask or face cover, we should:
-	Avoid being in crowded places.
-	Handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds even if our hands do not look dirty. If there is not water, we should use hand sanitizer.
-	Keep 6 feet (2 meters) apart from others. In doing so we prevent infecting people if we are infected or getting infected if we are not.
-	If we cough or sneeze, we must cover our nose and mouth with a tissue or our elbow, throw the dirty tissue in the rubbish and then wash our hands.
-	Do not touch our eyes, nose or mouth without first washing our hands.
-	Keep windows open and avoid stuffy places.
-	Be vaccinated.

IMPORTANT: Children younger than 2 years old do not have to wear mask.

¿Is there any drug to prevent COVID-19?
To date, there isn’t any drug which can prevent COVID-19.

¿How should we use the hand sanitizer?
We should apply enough hand sanitizer in our palm to cover both hands. Rub hands until they are dry, for 20 o 30 seconds approximately.

¿When to wear a mask?
We should wear a mask properly if:
-	We are out of the home where we cannot keep a distance of 6 feet or 2 meters from others (public transport, markets, streets).
-	We are at home with someone else who does not come from the same household. We should keep 6 feet away from the visitor as well.

¿What foods empower the defenses of our body?
It is recommended to eat whole grains, beans, vegetables, fresh fruits, nuts and animal source food in a healthy and balanced diet. There isn’t any food that can prevent COVID-19.

## [vaccine:syringe] Vaccines
Vaccines are safe and save 3 million of lives each year. There are vaccines to prevent at least 20 diseases.

Vaccination is essential to protect people’s health, as this aids the development and economy of each country.

¿How do vaccines work?
Vaccines train our body how to recognize and defend itself against viruses and bacteria, reducing the risk of the disease occurring.

¿Can vaccines cause autism?
No. Vaccines, such as the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), do not cause autism.

¿Is there any vaccine to prevent COVID-19?	
Yes. There are at least 13 different vaccines being using in many countries. Of them, 7 (Pfizer/BioNtech Comirnaty, AstraZeneca/AZD1222, SII/Covishield, Janssen/AD26.COV 2S, Moderna, Sinopharm y Sinovac) are in the list of emergency use of the World Health Organization.

¿Can COVID-19 vaccines stop the pandemic?
COVID-19 vaccines are one of the biggest measures to stop the pandemic. However, ending of the pandemic of many factors, as new variants and how many people are vaccinated.

¿What types of COVID-19 vaccines are and how do they work?
-	Inactivated vaccines: have inactivated or weakened COVID-19 viruses that enable our bodies to produce antibodies without getting sick.
-	Protein-based vaccines: have parts of the COVID-19 virus (proteins) that don’t cause the illness but make our body recognize them as foreign and enable our bodies to learn how to eliminate future infections.
-	RNA and DNA vaccines: have genes of the COVID-19 virus, these genes give indications to our body to produce a unique part (protein) of the virus that is harmless, our body can recognize and defend itself against the coronavirus. After this protein is produced, our body eliminates these genes.
-	Viral vector vaccines: have genes of the COVID-19 virus that are added to other weakened viruses. Our body produces a part of the virus (protein) that is recognized as foreign and then is removed.

¿Should I keep following the preventive measures after being vaccinated?
Yes. To help to stop this pandemic, after being vaccinated we should keep practising the preventive measures, such as physical distance, covering nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, handwashing, avoid closed places and wear mask.

¿Can vaccines protect us of the new COVID-19 virus variants?
Yes. COVID-19 vaccine protection could decrease against new variants, such as the Delta variant. However, COVID-19 vaccines are still effective.

¿Does the protection of the COVID-19 vaccine last forever?
It is unknown yet. More research is needed to clarify how long the protection of the COVID-19 vaccines could last.

¿Do vaccines are safe?
Yes. Vaccines are safe and effective. The World Health Organization continuously evaluate COVID-19vaccine safety.

¿What adverse effects could the COVID-19 vaccine cause?
Pain and swelling of the arm where the vaccine was shot, fever, chills, tiredness, and headache. There have been very few causing serious adverse effects. You should see your doctor if these complaints last more than 2 days.

¿Could COVID-19 vaccines cause clots in blood?
Rarely. There have been rare cases where AstraZeneca vaccines (4 or 6 persons per each million of vaccinated people) and Johnson (28 persons per more than 8 millions of vaccinated people) caused clots in blood 3 to 30 days after vaccination.

¿Could COVID-19 vaccines cause inflammation of the heart or its covering (myocarditis or pericarditis)?
Rarely. There have been rare cases of myocarditis or pericarditis after the second shot of mRNA.

¿Can vaccines cause allergic reactions?
Rarely. A severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, could be caused by any vaccine. After a vaccine shot, people are asked to stay in observation of any adverse effect, specially people who have previously had an allergic reaction.

¿Does having adverse effects mean the vaccine is working?
No. Having adverse effects do not mean our body is producing defenses. There is no need to have adverse effects after vaccination to be protected.

¿Can I be vaccinated if I had COVID-19?
Yes. Someone who had COVID-19 can be vaccinated. Vaccines protect us from having a severe COVID-19 and die.

¿How long should I wait to get vaccinated if I have COVID-19?
As soon as you recover from COVID-19 symptoms.

¿How many vaccine doses are needed?
Most of the COVID-19 vaccines consist of 2 jabs. However, there are one dose vaccines as effective as the 2 doses ones. 

¿Can I have the second jab from another different vaccine?
It is unknown yet. Currently, there are being researched if the second jab could be from a different vaccine than the one used in the first jab.

¿How long does it take for my body to develop protection after being vaccinated?
Two to three weeks after being completed vaccinated (2 o 1 doses, it depends on the type of vaccine used).

¿Is a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine needed?
No, mostly. In the USA a third dose of mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) is recommended, 4 weeks after the second dose, only to people with very low defenses (moderately or severely immunocompromised). It must be clear that this third dose is not a booster dose.

¿Is a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine needed?
To date, there is not enough evidence that a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine is needed.

However, on the 22nd of September in the USA the FDA gave an emergency authorization to a booster dose of the Pfizer (Comirnaty) vaccine. This single dose will be administered at least 6 months after having completed the primary doses of the COVID-19 vaccines, to:
-	People 65 years old or older.
-	People 18 to 64 years old who are at highest risk of developing severe COVID-19.
-	People 18 to 64 years old whose work or occupation put them at high risk to get infected with the COVID-19 virus, such as health workers.

¿Can I get infected and transmit the COVID-19 virus after being vaccinated?
It is very unlikely. The risk of a fully vaccinated person could get infected and transmit the COVID-19 virus is really low, because the virus load and transmission period is lesser than an unvaccinated one. 

¿Could I have COVID-19 after being vaccinated?
It is really unlikely. Vaccine protection for severe COVID-19 and death is higher than the protection for infection and transmission. There isn’t any vaccine 100% effective.

¿Can I get vaccinated if I have my period?
Yes. A woman can get vaccinated in any moment of her period, even in her menses.

¿Do pneumonia vaccines prevent or protect against COVID-19?
No. Pneumonia vaccines such as pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) do not protect against the COVID-19 virus. COVID-19 needs its own vaccine. However, it is recommended to get these vaccines to prevent other forms of pneumonia.

¿Does the Influenza vaccine prevent COVID-19?
No. The Influenza virus is a different virus than the COVID-19 virus, despite their symptoms being quite similar. However, it is recommended that people who have recovered from COVID-19 get vaccinated against Influenza.

## [masks:headSideMask] Mask or face cover wearing
¿What steps we must follow to wear a mask or face cover properly? 
- Wash our hands before putting on the mask.
- Make sure of covering mouth and nose with the mask, adjust it to the nasal bone, and fast it in order to decrease spaces between the mask and the face (to avoid these spaces do not cross the ear loops mask over).
- Avoid touching the mask while we are wearing it.
- Do not wear a mask around the chin, neck, arm or wrist.
- To remove the mask, unfasten or untie the mask from behind without touching it. 
- Do not remove the mask to speak.
- Wash our hands after removing or touching the mask.
- If the mask gets wet or dirty, change it for a new and dry mask.
- We should change of mask at least every day.
- Never reuse a disposable mask. Change it for a new one after each use.
- Avoid wearing masks with exhalation valves; they cannot filter the exhaled air.
- Do not share a mask with anybody. The mask is personal.
- People at high risk to developing severe COVID-19 symptoms should wear medical  masks.

¿What could happen if I do not wear a mask or face cover properly?
- We could self contaminate if we touch the mask and then touch our eyes, nose and mouth without first washing our hands.
- We could self contaminate if we do not change the mask when it gets dirty or wet.
- We could have breathing difficulty or headache if we do not choose a suitable mask. It is important to choose a mask that fits us while being able to breathe comfortably.
- If we wear a mask for a long period, it could cause skin irritation. Let’s choose a mask that doesn’t bother us.
- It could make communication difficult, especially for people with hearing difficulties. To avoid this problem, speak slowly and pronounce as clearly as possible.
- We may have a sense of false security and do not continue practicing the most important preventive measures, such as handwashing and physical distancing.
- Rubbish increment occurs if we do not dispose of single use masks properly. We could avoid this by wearing a cloth mask.

¿What are the benefits of wearing a mask or face cover properly?
- We reduce the transmission risk, avoid getting infected or spreading the virus if we are sick. 
- It decreases stigmatization (discrimination) of people who regularly have to wear a mask due to other diseases, like Tuberculosis.
- Give us a feeling that we can help in some way to stop the spreading of the COVID-19 virus.
- Make us remember that we should follow the other preventive measures, such as handwashing, do not touch our eyes/nose/mouth, physical distancing and covering mouth/face when coughing/sneezing.
- Prevents other diseases such as Tuberculosis and Influenza.
- We could have an extra income if we make reusable masks and sell them. Wearing cloth masks are cheaper and reduce the amount of rubbish generated by disposable masks.

¿What are the recommendations for the manufacture and washing of a fabric/cloth mask?
- The fabric mask requirements are: filtration (retain small drops), breathability (easy to breathe through the cloth) and fit (suit our face comfortably without adjust too much).
- Do not use elastic cloth to make the mask, as it cannot be washed with hot water as the fabric will stretch.
- Use fabric that can resist high temperatures (60°C or more).
- A cloth mask has to have at least 3 layers: 1) the inner layer that is in contact with the mouth and nose should absorb fluid, it could be of cotton or a cotton blend cloth; 2) the middle layer should not absorb fluid, it could be of polypropylene, polyester or polyaramid, and 3) the outer layer should also not absorb liquid, it could be polypropylene, polyester, or a blend of both. 
- Avoid fabric masks with exhalation valves, they cannot filter the exhaled air.
- A fabric mask should be washed at least daily.
- Do not wash cloth masks with other clothes.
- Wash cloth masks with soup/detergent and hot water (at least at 60°C). If there isn’t hot water, boil masks for 1 minute after washing them.
- Check on the mask label what is the higher temperature it could be washed. 

¿Could we wear just a face shield?
No. The face shield should always be worn with a mask or face cover.

¿Can wearing a mask for a long time cause carbon dioxide (CO2) intoxication or oxygen deficiency?
No. Wearing a mask for a long period could be annoying but it does not cause neither carbon dioxide intoxication nor oxygen deficiency. Let’s choose a comfortable mask which enabled us to breathe easily through it.

¿Should a mask be worn while doing exercise?
No. Someone who is doing exercise shouldn’t wear a mask as breathing is uncomfortable. Also, the mask gets wet with sweating making breathe even more difficult and allows microbes grow in the mask. 
The main measure while doing exercise is being outdoors and to keep 2 or at least 1 meter apart from others.

## [rumors:users] Hearsays
There are hearsays about COVID-19 prevention that could be very harmful if we practice them. People who follow these hearsays or myths are in fact hindering the preventative measures set in place.

¿Does fumigating houses or offices prevent COVID-19?
No. Fumigating a closed place such as a house, office, or health center can harm people’s health. To disinfect a place, it should be cleaned with water and detergent to eliminate the dirt first and, then, a disinfectant should be applied with a cloth enabling the disinfectant to cover all surfaces.

¿Does fumigating streets prevent COVID-19?
No. Fumigating open places such as streets or markets does not kill the virus of COVID-19. Disinfectants do not work with dirt. Moreover, when fumigating, disinfectants do not cover all surfaces to remove the virus.

¿Does fumigating or spraying people with disinfectants prevent COVID-19?
No. Fumigating or spraying people with any disinfectant does not decrease the risk of COVID-19 virus transmission. These substances can cause breathing difficulty, vomiting and skin or eye irritation.

¿Does introducing bleach into someone prevent COVID-19?
No. Introducing bleach into the body can be dangerous and even deadly. Bleach or other disinfectants should only be used to disinfect objects or surfaces like chairs, handles, stair handrail, floors, walls, etc.

¿Can Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Chlorine dioxide is used in water treatment plants. Drinking ClO2 can cause serious consequences, even death.

¿Does drinking alcohol, methanol, ethanol or bleach prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Methanol, ethanol (medical alcohol to disinfect) and bleach are toxic. These substances are only to disinfect objects or surfaces, but never to be drunk, it could be fatal.

¿Does drinking alcoholic beverages can prevent COVID-19?
No. Drinking alcoholic beverages does not prevent COVID-19.

¿Does vaporizing eucalyptus prevent COVID-19?
There isn’t evidence that eucalyptus can kill any virus or bacteria.

¿Does rinsing mouth or nose with saline prevent COVID-19?
No. Rinsing the mouth or nose with saline could improve cold symptoms, but it doesn’t prevent or kill the COVID-19 virus.

¿Does cold weather kill the COVID-19 virus?
No. Cold weather with snowing doesn’t kill the COVID-19 virus. Average body temperature is around 36.5°C and 37°C whatever the temperature outside, it’s irrelevant.

¿Does hot weather kill the COVID-19 virus?
No. Hot weather doesn’t kill any virus. COVID-19 transmission can increase in cold weather because people spend more time indoors with closed windows.

¿Can UV lamps disinfect hands or other body parts?
No. Ultraviolet lamps cannot disinfect any part of our body. UV rays can cause skin and eyes irritation.

¿Can hand dryers kill the COVID-19 virus?
No. Hand dryers cannot kill the coronavirus. We should wash our hands with water and soap first before drying them using a cloth/paper towel or a warm air dryer.

¿Does taking a hot bath prevent COVID-19?
No. Hot baths do not prevent COVID-19. Bathing with very hot water can cause burns. Body temperature is around 36.5°C and 37°C whatever the environmental temperature is.

¿Does exposure to the sun or temperatures higher than 25°C prevent COVID-19?
No. Exposure to the sun doesn’t prevent or cure COVID-19.

¿Does eating hot pepper or spicy food prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Chili or hot pepper can empower food taste, but they don’t prevent or cure COVID-19.

¿Does eating ginger or garlic prevent COVID-19?
No. Ginger and garlic can improve our meals, but there isn’t evidence that they could prevent COVID-19.

¿Does hand sanitizer produce antibiotic resistance?
No. Hand sanitizer could be used frequently without cause resistance to any virus or bacteria.

¿Is it safe to use hand sanitizer?
Yes. Everybody could use hand sanitizer. The alcohol absorbed through the skin is really little and the gel prevents our hands from parched.

¿Can hand sanitizer be used in religions where alcohol is banned?
Yes. The Holy Scripture allows using any substance that can help to prevent diseases.

¿Is wearing gloves safer than washing our hands?
No. We can transfer germs from one place to another when wearing gloves and get contaminated when taking them off. Washing hands frequently is much safer.

¿Can I get infected while using a public hand sanitizer bottle?
No. After rubbing our hands with alcohol gel, our hands are disinfected of any germ that would have been in the public hand sanitizer bottle.

¿Are COVID-19 vaccines part of a “program for mass extermination”?
No. Vaccines are not a program for mass extermination or a strategy to implant chips. Vaccines are safe, it has been confirmed by conclusive research. mRNA vaccines do not have the live COVID-19 virus and do not interfere with the human DNA.

¿Could COVID-19 vaccines produce infertility?
No. Vaccines do not produce infertility. There is too much fake news about vaccines that cause fear and distrust in people so they don’t want to get vaccinated. Fake news is quite harmful and limits the most effective preventive measure, vaccination.


# [symptons:sick] SYMPTOMS 
Our body could react in different ways to the COVID-19 virus. Reactions can vary from having no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe cases where the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, blood vessels and even nervous system can be damaged.

¿When do symptoms begin?
COVID-19 symptoms could begin up to 14 days after a person is infected with the virus.

¿Is it important to quarantine or self-isolate?
Yes. Do quarantine or self-isolate is really important because it can help to stop the spread of COVID-19.

¿When should people quarantine or self isolate? 
Quarantine: If a person was in close contact with someone who has or might have COVID-19, they should stay at home for 14 days and sleep in a single room regardless if their laboratory results are positive or negative.
Isolation: If a person gets infected by the COVID-19 virus, they should stay at home in a single room for at least 10 days from the onset of symptoms and up to 3 days after symptoms have improved or without fever.

¿Which are COVID-19 symptoms?
The most known symptoms are:
- Fever (body temperature higher than 38°C) or chills. Most of elderly people do not develop fever.
-	Cough
-	Breathing difficulty (feeling a lack of air)
-	Body or muscle aches
-	Headache
-	Sickness
-	Nasal congestion and runny nose
-	Loss of smell
-	Loss of taste
-	Sore throat
-	Stomachache (abdominal pain)
-	Lack of appetite
-	Nausea and vomiting
-	Tiredness or fatigue
-	Delusions (in elderly people)
-	Skin eruptions (rash)
 
¿When should I go to the hospital?
Go to the hospital's emergency service immediately if you have:
- Fever for more than 2 days.
- Breathing difficulty.
- Chest ache or oppression
- Awakeness difficulty
- Blue lips or face (cyanosis)
- Oxygen saturation less than 95% (check it in a warm finger). A person with COVID-19 may not be aware when their saturation is going down.

¿Could asymptomatic people get sick after all?
Yes. There have been asymptomatic people who develop pneumonia.

¿Could someone who had COVID-19 continue having symptoms?
Yes. Some people who had COVID-19 can continue having symptoms as fatigue or tiredness, breathing difficulty, chest ache, palpitations, mental problems, loss of smell or taste, numbness of arms and legs for months. If symptoms persist, go to the doctor.

# [conditions:accessibility_new] PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL CONDITIONS
## [risky_people:accessibility_new] People at risk
People at higher risks to developing severe COVID-19 symptoms have the following conditions:
- Older than 60 
- Arterial hypertension
- Cardiovascular diseases (stroke) 
- Diabetes
- Chronic lung diseases (asthma, chronic bronchitis)
- Chronic liver diseases
- Immunosuppressive treatment (cancer or transplant rejection treatment)
- Kidney diseases (renal insufficiency)
- Obesity
- Blood disorders (sickle cell disease)
- Pregnant wome
- Cigarette smokers.

¿Does the COVID-19 virus infect more elderly or young people? 
Anyone of any age can be infected by the COVD-19 virus.

## [pregnant:pregnant_woman] Pregnant women
Pregnant women can develop mild COVID-19 symptoms, which can be managed with medical care at home. However, pregnant women experiencing severe COVID-19 symptoms will need hospitalization.

¿Are pregnant women more at risk of developing severe COVID-19?
Yes. Specially pregnant women who are older or are overweight, or have hypertension, diabetes or other diseases may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.

¿Could a pregnant woman transmit the COVID-19 virus to her baby?
It is really unlikely. It hasn’t been found the COVID-19 virus in the fluid surrounding the baby in the womb.

¿Can a pregnant woman be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus?
Yes. Despite the limited data about pregnant women and COVID-19 vaccines, it is recommended that pregnant women get vaccinated due to the high risk of developing severe COVID-19. 

¿Should delivery of a pregnant woman who had COVID-19 be induced earlier?
No. A pregnant woman who has recovered from COVID-19 should have the same delivery schedule as someone who did not have COVID-19.

¿Should the delivery of a pregnant woman with COVID-19 be by cesarean section?
No. The delivery by cesarean section should only be done for the benefit of the mother or baby.

¿Could a mother with COVID-19 breastfeed her baby?
Yes. Breastmilk is the best food for the baby. If a mother has COVID-19, she should wash her hands carefully and wear a mask before breastfeeding. To date, the COVID-19 virus has not been found in the breastmilk.

¿Could a vaccinated mother breastfeed her baby?
Yes. It is recommended that a mother who gets vaccinated continue breastfeeding her baby.

## [children:child] Children
The amount of hospitalizations and admissions to the intensive care unit is lower in children than in adults. Apparently, COVID-19 could be less severe in children.

Children younger than 2 should not wear a mask. They would need an adult to assist putting on or removing a mask permanently. Therefore, it is unsafe for children of these ages to wear a mask.

¿Which child is at risk of developing severe COVID-19?
It is likely that children younger than 1 year and with some special conditions (development delay or genetic syndromes as Down syndrome), who are immunocompromised (with low defenses) or with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, obesity, diabetes or cardiovascular diseases could be at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. 

¿What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)?
It is a complication of COVID-19 in children and teenagers. They have a fever for 3 days, systemic inflammation and impaired organs such as the heart, kidneys, skin, blood, digestive system and nervous system. There have been many cases but fortunately few deaths.

¿Can children be vaccinated?
In some countries, as the USA, children older than 12 years old with risk factors can be vaccinated.

¿Can children transmit the COVID-19 virus?
Yes. Children can get infected, be sick and transmit the COVID-19 virus.

## [cancer:sick] Cancer
¿Does a person with cancer have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19?
It is likely that people with cancer who are on treatment may develop severe COVID-19.

¿Is someone who recovered from cancer at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19?
It is not clear if people who previously had cancer are at a higher risk of becoming ill seriously from COVID-19.

¿Are children with cancer at lower risks than adults of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms?
It appears that children with cancer develop milder COVD-19 symptoms than adults with cancer.

¿Which tests should be used if a person has cancer?
It is recommended to use molecular tests if a person with cancer develops COVID-19 symptoms.

¿Can a person with cancer be vaccinated?
Yes. People with cancer or who have cancer treatment can be vaccinated. Any COVID-19 vaccine has live virus, so vaccines are safe.

## [hiv:sick] HIV
¿Which symptoms a person with HIV could develop if they have COVID-19?
A person living with HIV on regular antiretroviral treatment can develop similar COVID-19 symptoms as a person without HIV.

¿Do people living with HIV have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19?
It seems that people living with HIV could be at a higher risk of being developing severe COVID-19.

¿Can people living with HIV be vaccinated?
Yes. It is recommended that people living with HIV be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus, regardless of their CD4 count of viral load. Vaccines are safe because they don’t have a live virus.

## [tuberculosis:sick] Tuberculosis (TB)
¿How has the fight against tuberculosis been affected by the pandemic?
The pandemic has affected the efficacy in diagnostic tuberculosis. Of 4 people who usually would have been diagnosed with tuberculosis, only 3 were diagnosed due to the pandemic. This person who has tuberculosis and isn’t diagnosed is spreading the bacillus of tuberculosis without knowing it.
 
¿Is a person with tuberculosis at a higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19?
It is unknown. Even though COVID-19 and tuberculosis have similar risk factors, it is unknown if a person with tuberculosis is at higher risk to develop severe COVID-19.

¿Does the transmission of tuberculosis and COVID-19 happen in the same way?
Transmission is similar. Tuberculosis and COVID-19 are spread when someone ill is in close contact with a healthy person, especially when someone coughs, sneezes, sings or yells.
The bacilli of tuberculosis could be in the air for many hours. A healthy person could get infected with tuberculosis if they inhale these bacilli. The amount of bacilli decreases with sunlight and natural ventilation.

¿Can the same sample be used to diagnose tuberculosis and COVID-19?
Mainly no. Samples for tuberculosis and COVID-19 vary. However, sputum or endotracheal or bronchoalveolar lavage samples could be used to diagnose both diseases.

¿Should tuberculosis and COVID-19 be ruled out at once?
If someone had been exposed to COVID-19 as well as to tuberculosis, both diseases should be ruled out because symptoms and risk factors are similar.

¿Does a person with tuberculosis have a different TB treatment if they get infected with the COVID-19 virus?
Most tuberculosis treatments are not different with or without COVID-19. Preventive (prophylaxis) treatment and tuberculosis disease treatment do not have to be stopped. Of 2 people who stop TB treatment, 1 could die.

¿Can someone with tuberculosis be vaccinated?
Yes. Someone with active tuberculosis must be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus.

¿Does BCG vaccine protect against COVID-19?
It isn’t recommended BCG vaccine to prevent COVID-19.


# [detection:diagnoses] TESTS
There are 3 types:
- Molecular tests: identify the COVID-19 virus, also known as NAATs.
- Rapid antigen tests: identify parts (proteins) of the COVID-19 virus.
- Serological tests: identify the defenses (antibodies) generated by the body when get infected by the COVID-19 virus.

¿How to know if someone has COVID-19?
To know if someone has COVID-19 it is recommended to use a molecular test. An antigen test could be used, although its results sometimes are not accurate because it depends on the amount of virus a person at the time of the test.

¿How to know if someone had COVID-19?
To know if someone had COVID-19 it is recommended to use a serological test and also a molecular test or antigen test to make sure that the virus of COVID-19 is no longer in the body. 

¿When can molecular tests read positive?
In most COVID-19 cases, 5 days after a person has been infected or 1 to 3 days before the onset of symptoms.

¿When can antigen tests read positive?
In most COVID-19 cases, rapid antigen tests can read positive 1 to 3 days before the onset of symptoms and up until 5 to 7 days of disease.

¿When can serological tests read positive?
Most people with COVID-19 have positive serological tests 21 days or more after the onset of symptoms.

¿What samples are needed for molecular tests?
Molecular tests mainly use the nose and throat (upper respiratoy) and/or lower respiratory samples. Sometimes faecal samples are used.

¿What samples are needed for antigen tests?
Rapid antigen tests use nose and throat samples. 

¿What samples are needed for serologic tests?
Serologic or antibodies tests use blood samples.

¿Could serological tests determine if someone can go back to their work?	
It is not recommended. Serological tests shouldn’t determine if a person could go back to work, college, school or any other place where people group together.

¿Can serologic tests determine if someone must be vaccinated or mustn’t?
It isn’t recommended. Serologic tests cannot be used to decide who must be vaccinated or who mustn’t.

¿Can serologic tests determine the immunity against COVID-19 in a vaccinated person?
It isn’t recommended. Serologic tests cannot determine the immunity response against the COVID-19 virus in a person full vaccinated.

¿Could someone who had COVID-19 get infected again (reinfection)?
Yes. There have been some COVID-19 cases of reinfection although they are rare. Antibodies generated by our body may not last forever or may not protect our bodies from a second infection (reinfection).

¿Could thermal scanners detect the virus of COVID-19?
No. Thermal scanners detect if someone has a fever, not the COVID-19 virus. There are many diseases which can cause fever.

¿Does the ability to hold one’s breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort rule out COVID-19?
No. Breath exercises cannot diagnose any disease. Only laboratory tests can determine if someone has COVID-19 or not.

¿Could pulse oximeters detect the COVID-19 virus?
No. The pulse oximeter detects oxygen saturation being the percentage of oxygen in blood (hemoglobin), normal values are between 95 to 100% for a healthy person. Even though COVID-19 could lower our oxygen levels, only laboratory tests can detect the virus of COVID-19.

¿Does being able to smell and taste wine or vinegar rule out COVID-19?
No. Only laboratory tests could rule out COVID-19. There are other diseases, which also can cause a loss of taste and smell.


# [treatment:healing] TREATMENT
As COVID-19 symptoms could be different from person to person, treatment is also different. Severe COVID-19 needs oxygen and other drugs depending on the disease’s course. The right and early treatment can avoid complications and even death. 

¿If someone is receiving treatment for another disease apart from COVID-19, should they stop their previous treatment?
No. A person who previously is taking anticoagulant (warfarin), antiplatelet (aspirin), antihypertensive (captopril, enalapril, losartan), statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin), corticosteroid (dexamethasone, prednisone), NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib) drugs for any other disease, should continue their treatment, regardless if a person has COVID-19 or not.  
This person must go to their doctor because they could be at higher risk of developing  COVID-19 complications.

¿Could Remdesivir be used as general COVID-19 treatment?
No. In the USA, the FDA approved Remdesivir as COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized patients who need oxygen. But, WHO recommends waiting for more evidence of its effectiveness. 

¿Could Dexamethasone be used as general COVID-19 treatment?
No. Dexamethasone, which has an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effect, is only recommended for hospitalized COVID-19 patients who need oxygen.

¿Can recovered COVID people’s blood be used as a COVID-19 treatment?
It might be likely that COVID-19 convalescent plasma, blood of people who had COVID-19 and then recovered, can be used to treat hospitalized patients. It is still in research.

¿Can Hydroxychloroquine or Chloroquine cure or prevent COVID-19?	
It is not recommended. Researches show that Hydroxychloroquine does not prevent or cure COVID-19.

¿Can Ivermectin cure or prevent COVID-19?
It is not recommended. To date, there isn’t any conclusive evidence to support that Ivermectin prevents or cures COVID-19.

¿Can antibiotics prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Antibiotics do not work against the virus. Some people with COVID-19 could get a bacterial infection as a complication. Additionally, antibiotics should only be prescribed by doctors.

¿Why is taking antibiotics not convenient to prevent or cure COVID-19?
Antibiotics work against bacteria. If we take antibiotics unnecessarily, bacteria could become resistant to these drugs. So, when antibiotics are truly needed, they will not work. Only doctors can determine if antibiotics are needed or not.

¿Can vitamin C, vitamin D and Zinc prevent or cure COVID-19?
To date, there isn’t evidence. Vitamin C, vitamin D and Zinc do not cure or prevent COVID-19. However, they are supplements which help the immune system to better function.


# [home:home] WHEN THERE IS SOMEONE SICK AT HOME
¿What we should do if we have COVID-19 symptoms?
- Stay at home. We should only get out to go to the doctor or hospital.
- Seek for medical care and call a doctor as soon as symptoms begin.
- Rest and do not stress. Having good mental health is important.
- Drink water to keep hydrated.
- Stay in a separate room, with open windows.
- Use an independent bathroom, if it is possible.
- Keep windows open enabling fresh air in the house. More fresh air means fewer viruses.
- Avoid sharing common areas like the living room, dining room, kitchen. Also, when we do share a common room we should limit the amount of time we stay there.
- Practice preventive measures such as handwashing, physical distancing and covering our nose/mouth when coughing or sneezing.
- Wear a medic mask most of the time, change a mask every day. If wearing a mask is impossible, cover mouth/nose with a tissue when sneezing/coughing or speaking/laughing and then throw the dirty tissue into the rubbish.
- Avoid contaminating things or surfaces with saliva or respiratory secretions such as mucus or sputum, it reduces the risk of virus transmission.
- Clean and disinfect things and surfaces we touched frequently.
- Avoid being close to animals or pets. There have been some few cases of dogs and cats infected by the COVID-19 virus because they were close to people with COVID-19.

¿What we should do if there is someone with COVID-19 at home?
- Choose a person to care for the sick one, if it is possible, this person should not be pregnant or at higher risk of developing severe coronavirus disease.
- If we care for a sick person, we could get infected and transmit the COVID-19 virus to others. It is extremely important to practice all the preventive measures such as handwashing, physical distancing, covering our mouth/nose when coughing/sneezing and always wearing mask.
- Wash hands with soap and water before and after touching the infected person. Wet wipes do not substitute handwashing.
- Stay 6 feet (2 meters) apart from the sick person.
- Do not be face to face to the sick person.
- Wear a mask when being in the bedroom of the sick person.
- Remove all things contaminated with secretions of the sick person like tissues, and then practice handwashing with soap and water.
- Keep windows open.
- Clean and disinfect things that the infected person uses or touches.

¿What disinfectants could we use against the COVID-19 virus?
- Ethanol at 70 - 90% (medical alcohol used before a shot)
- Chlorine based products (like bleach) at 0.1% for general disinfection and at 0.5% for places with blood and body secretions. 
- Hydrogen peroxide >0.5% (oxygenated water).
These substances should cover the surface for at least 1 minute to be disinfected (or depending on the maker's instructions).
