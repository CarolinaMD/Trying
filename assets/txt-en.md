# [origin:virus] ORIGIN 
¿What is COVID-19?
It is a new disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 means “COronaVIrus Disease 2019”.

¿Which is the origin of COVID-19?
Many researchers are agree that the virus of COVID-19 has an animal origin, most likely bats.

¿Was the virus of COVID-19 made in a laboratory?
No. If the virus of COVID-19 would be created in a laboratory, its genes would have known sequences (parts). This is not the case.

¿What does the mutation of COVID-19 mean?
All viruses change or mutate developing new “variants”, some more so than others. These mutations could change the transmissibility and severity of the disease. The COVID-19 virus changes rather slowly compared to influenza virus or HIV.

# [transmission:share] TRANSMISSION 
Mainly, COVID-19 is transmitted through little drops expelled when an infected person breathes, speaks, sings, sneezes or coughs. These drops could be spread around 6 feet (2 meters) and get caught through the eyes, nose, and or mouth of others close to the infected person.

¿Could COVID-19 be spread by touching contaminated things?
It is possible. When a person touches contaminated objects (tables or door handles used by a sick person) and then touches their eyes, nose and mouth without washing their hands previously is when a person may become infected.

¿Could asymptomatic people transmit the COVID-19 virus?
Yes. Symptomatic (who have symptoms), presymptomatic (who do not have symptoms yet) and asymptomatic (who do not have symptoms) people could transmit the COVID-19 virus.

¿Does getting infected with the COVID-19 virus mean that I will have the virus in my body forever?
No. Most of the people infected by COVID-19 virus recover and eliminate the virus. Some people could continue having symptoms months later but it does not mean that they have the virus in their bodies.

¿Could shoes spread the COVID-19 virus?
The chance that the virus could be spread by shoes is really unlikely. Shoes could be left at the entrance of houses where there are kids playing or crawling on the floor.

¿Could houseflies transmit the COVID-19 virus?
No. To date, there isn’t any evidence showing that houseflies could spread the COVID-19 virus.

¿May 5G mobile networks transmit the COVID-19 virus?
No. Viruses cannot travel through radio waves or mobile networks. Viruses need a cell to stay alive. Places where there isn’t any 5G mobile network, have COVID-19 cases.

¿Could the COVID-19 virus be transmitted by mosquito bites?
No. To date, there isn’t any research showing that mosquito bites could spread the COVID-19 virus.

¿May blood products transmit the COVID-19 virus?
To date, there isn’t any evidence suggesting that the COVID-19 virus could be transmitted through blood products.

¿Can the COVID-19 virus be spread in places with hot and wet weather?
Yes. The COVID-19 virus could be transmitted in any place, whatever it is sunny or cold. Countries with hot weather have COVID-19 cases. 

¿May the COVID-19 virus be spread through water?
No. The COVID-19 virus cannot be spread through water whether we are in the sea or swimming pool. Keep at least 1 meter apart from others and wear a mask outside the water.

# [symptons:sick] SYMPTOMS 
Our body could react in different ways to the COVID-19 virus. Reactions can vary from having no symptoms (asymptomatic) to  severe cases where the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, blood vessels and even nervous system can be damaged.

¿When symptoms begin?
COVID-19 symptoms could begin up to 14 days after a person is infected with the virus.

¿When should people quarantine or self isolate? 
Quarantine: If a person was in close contact with someone with COVID-19, they should stay at home for 14 days regardless if their laboratory results are, positive or negative.
Isolation: If a person has COVID-19, they should stay at home for 14 days, or, at least 10 days from the onset of symptoms and up to 3 days after symptoms have improved or without a fever.

¿Which are COVID-19 symptoms?
The most known symptoms are:
- Fever (body temperature higher than 38°C) or chills. Most of elderly people do not develop fever.
- cough
- breathing difficulty (feeling a lack of air)
- body or muscle aches
- headache
- sickness
- nasal congestion and runny nose
- loss of smell
- loss of taste
- sore throat
- stomachache (abdominal pain)
- lack of appetite
- nausea and vomiting
- tiredness or fatigue
- delusions (in elderly people)

¿When should I go to the hospital?
Go to the hospital's emergency service immediately if you have:
- Fever for more than 2 days.
- Breathing difficulty.
- Chest ache or oppression
- Awakeness difficulty
- Blue lips or face (cyanosis)
- Oxygen saturation less than 95%. A person with COVID-19 may not aware when their saturation is going down.

¿Could asymptomatic people get sick after all?
Yes. There have been asymptomatic people who develop pneumonia.

¿Could someone who had COVID-19 continue having symptoms?
Yes. Some people who had COVID-19 can continue having symptoms as fatigue or tiredness, breathing difficulty, chest ache, palpitations, mental problems, loss of smell or taste, numbness of arms and legs for months. If symptoms persist, go to the doctor.

# [conditions:accessibility_new] PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL CONDITIONS
## [risky_people:accessibility_new] People at risk
People at higher risks to developing severe COVID-19 symptoms have the following conditions:
- Older than 60 
- Arterial hypertension
- Cardiovascular diseases (stroke) 
- Diabetes
- Chronic lung diseases (asthma, chronic bronchitis)
- Chronic liver diseases
- Immunosuppressive treatment (cancer or transplant rejection treatment)
- Kidney diseases (renal insufficiency)
- Obesity
- Blood disorders (sickle cell disease)

¿Does the COVID-19 virus infect more elderly or young people? 
Anyone of any age can be infected by the COVD-19 virus.

¿When is COVID-19 most contagious?
When there are many people, especially in closed places and or places with poor ventilation.

## [pregnant:pregnant_woman] Pregnant women
Pregnant women can develop mild COVID-19 symptoms, which can be managed with medical care at home. However, pregnant women experiencing severe COVID-19 symptoms will need hospitalization.

¿Are pregnant women are more at risk of developing severe COVID-19?
Pregnant women who are older or are overweight, or have hypertension, diabetes or other diseases may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.

¿Could a pregnant woman transmit the COVID-19 virus to her baby?
To date it is unknown. Nothing has been found to indicate that the COVID-19 virus can reside in the fluid surrounding the baby in the womb.

¿Should delivery of a pregnant woman who had COVID-19 be induced earlier?
No. A pregnant woman who recovered from COVID-19 has the same delivery schedule as someone who did not have COVID-19.

¿Should the delivery of a pregnant woman with COVID-19 be by cesarean section?
No. The delivery by cesarean section should only be indicated if it is medically needed (for the mother or baby benefit).

¿Could a mother with COVID-19 breastfeed her baby?
Yes. If a mother has COVID-19 she should wash her hands carefully and wear a mask before breastfeeding. To date, the COVID-19 virus has not been found in breastmilk.

## [children:child] Children
The amount of hospitalizations and admissions to the intensive care unit is lower in children than in adults. Apparently, COVID-19 could be less severe in children.
IMPORTANT: Children younger than 2 should not wear a mask.They would need an adult to assist putting on or removing a mask constantly. Therefore, it is unsafe for children of these ages to wear a mask.

¿Which child is at risk of developing severe COVID-19?
It is likely that children who are immunocompromised (with low defenses) or with chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma or cardiovascular diseases could be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.

¿What is multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)?
It is a complication of COVID-19 in children and teenagers. They have fever for 3 days, systemic inflammation and impaired organs such as heart, kidney, skin, blood, digestive system and nervous system. There have been many cases but fortunately few deaths.

## [cancer:sick] Cancer
¿Does a person with cancer have higher risk of developing severe COVID-19?
It is likely that people with cancer who are on treatment may develop severe COVID-19.

¿Is someone who recovered from cancer are at higher risk to develop severe COVID-19?
It is not clear if people who had cancer are at higher risk of becoming ill seriously from COVID-19.

¿Are children with cancer are at lower risks than adults of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms?
It appears that children with cancer develop a milder COVD-19 than adults with cancer.

¿Which tests should be used if a person has cancer?
It is recommended to use molecular tests if a person with cancer develop COVID-19 symptoms.

## [hiv:sick] HIV
¿Which symptoms a person with HIV could develop if they have COVID-19?
A person living with HIV on regularly antiretroviral treatment can develop similar COVID-19 symptoms than a person without HIV.

¿Do people with HIV be on higher risk to develop severe COVID-19?
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that people living with HIV are at higher risk of being infected or developing severe COVID-19.

## [tuberculosis:sick] Tuberculosis (TB)
¿How the fight against tuberculosis has been affected by the pandemic?
Of 4 people who normally would have been diagnosed with tuberculosis, only 3 were diagnosed due to the pandemic. This person without the Tuberculosis diagnosis is not on treatment and is spreading the bacillus of Tuberculosis right now without knowing it.

¿Is a person with tuberculosis at a higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19?
It is unknown. People with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or the elderly are more susceptible to developing Tuberculosis as well as COVID-19.

¿Does the transmission of tuberculosis and COVID-19 happen in the same way?
Tuberculosis and COVID-19 are spread when someone ill is in close contact to a healthy person especially when someone coughs, sneezes, sings or yells.
When someone with Tuberculosis coughs, sneezes, sings or yells expels bacilli of tuberculosis that could be in the air for many hours. A healthy person could get tuberculosis infection if breathe these bacilli. The amount of bacilli decrease with sunlight and natural ventilation.

¿Does a person with tuberculosis have a different TB treatment if they get infected with the virus of COVID-19?
Most of tuberculosis treatments are not different with or without COVID-19. Preventive (prophylaxis) treatment and tuberculosis disease treatment do not have to be stopped. Of 2 people who stop TB treatment, 1 could die.

# [detection:diagnoses] TESTS
There are 3 types:
- Molecular tests: identify the COVID-19 virus, also known as NAATs.
- Rapid antigen tests: identify parts (proteins) of the COVID-19 virus.
- Serological tests: identify the defenses (antibodies) generated by the body when get infected by the COVID-19 virus.

¿How to know if someone has COVID-19?
To know if someone has COVID-19 it is recommended to use a molecular test. An antigen test could be used, although its results sometimes are not accurate (it depends on the amount of virus a person has when is tested).

¿How to know if someone had COVID-19?
To know if someone has COVID-19 it is recommended to use a serological test and also a molecular test (to make sure that the virus of COVID-19 is no longer in the body).

¿When can molecular tests read positive?
In most COVID-19 cases, 5 days after a person has been infected, or 1 to 3 days before the onset of symptoms.

¿When can antigen tests read positive?
In most COVID-19 cases, rapid antigen tests can read positive 1 to 3 days before the onset of symptoms and up until 5 to 7 days of disease.

¿When can serological tests read positive?
Most of people with COVID-19 has positive serological tests 21 days or more after the onset of symptoms.

¿What samples are needed for molecular tests?
Molecular tests mainly use the nose and throat (upper and/or lower respiratory) samples. Sometimes faecal samples are used.

¿What samples are needed for antigen tests?
Rapid antigen tests use nose and throat samples.
  
¿What samples is needed for serologic tests?
Serologic or antibodies tests use blood samples.

¿Could serological tests determine if someone can go back to their work?	
It is not recommended. Serological tests shouldn’t determine if a person could back to work, college, school or any other place where people group together.

¿Could someone who had COVID-19 get infected again (reinfection)?
There have been some COVID-19 cases of reinfection although they are rare. Antibodies generated by our body may not last forever or may not protect our body of a second infection (reinfection).

¿Could thermal scanners detect the virus of COVID-19?
No. Thermal scanners detect if someone has fever, no the COVID-19 virus. There are many diseases which could produce fever.

¿Does the ability to hold one's breath for 10 seconds or more without coughing or feeling discomfort, rule out COVID-19?
No. Breath exercises cannot diagnose any disease. Only laboratory tests can determine if someone has COVID-19 or not.

¿Could pulse oximeter detect the virus of COVID-19?
No. The pulse oximeter detects oxygen saturation being the percentage of oxygen in blood (hemoglobin), normal values are between 95 to 100% for a healthy person. Even though COVID-19 could lower our oxygen levels, only laboratory tests can detect the virus of COVID-19.

¿Does being able to smell and taste wine or vinegar rule out COVID-19?
No. There are other diseases, which also can cause a loss of taste and smell. Only laboratory tests could rule out COVID-19. 

# [treatment:healing] TREATMENT
As COVID-19 symptoms could be different from person to person, treatment is also different. Severe COVID-19 needs oxygen and other drugs depending on the disease's course. The right and early treatment can avoid complications and even death.

¿If someone on treatment for another disease have COVID-19, should they stop their previous treatment?
No. A person who previously is taking anticoagulant (warfarin), antiplatelet (aspirin), antihypertensive (captopril, enalapril, losartan), statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin), corticosteroid (dexamethasone, prednisone), NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib) drugs for any other disease, should continue their treatment, regardless if a person has COVID-19 or not.
This person must go to their doctor because their previous disease could be putting them at risk factor of developing COVID-19 complications.

¿Could Remdesivir be used as general COVID-19 treatment?
No. In the USA, Remdesivir is approved as COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized patients who need oxygen.1 But, WHO recommends wait for more evidence of its effectiveness.

¿Could Dexamethasone be used as general COVID-19 treatment?
No. Dexamethasone is only recommended for hospitalized COVID-19 patients who need oxygen.

¿Can Hydroxychloroquine or Chloroquine cure or prevent COVID-19?	
To date, there isn’t evidence suggesting the Hydroxychloroquine or Chloroquine cure or prevent COVID-19. Unnecessary use of these drugs could produce serious adverse effects.

¿Can Ivermectin cure or prevent COVID-19?
To date, there isn’t evidence to support that Ivermectin prevents or cures COVID-19.

¿Can antibiotics prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Antibiotics do not work against virus. Some people with COVID-19 could get a bacterial infection as a complication. Additionally, antibiotics should only be prescribed by doctors.

¿Why taking antibiotics is not convenient to prevent or cure COVID-19?
Antibiotics are against bacteria. If we take antibiotics unnecessarily, bacteria could become resistant to these drugs and in the near future antibiotics can no longer kill bacteria. Only doctors can determine if antibiotics are needed or not.

¿Can vitamin C, vitamin D and Zinc prevent or cure COVID-19?
To date, there isn’t evidence. Vitamin C, vitamin D and Zinc are supplements which help the immune system to better function. They do not cure or prevent COVID-19.

¿Can recovered COVID peoples’ blood be used as a COVID-19 treatment?
To date, there isn’t evidence. It is unknown if blood or antibodies of people who have had COVID-19 and then recovered could treat COVID-19 in other people.

¿Can Chlorine Dioxide (ClO2) prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Chlorine dioxide is a gas used in water treatment plants. Drinking ClO2 can cause serious consequences, even death.

# [prevention:block] PREVENTION 
## [drugs:pills] Preventive measures
Preventive measures decrease the risk of COVID-19 infection. Wearing or not wearing mask (face cover), we should:
- Avoid being in crowded places.
- Handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. We should at least use hand sanitizer if our hands do not look dirty.
- Keep 6 feet (2 meters) apart from others. Doing so we prevent get infected or infect other if we are sick.
- If we cough or sneeze, we must cover our nose and mouth with a tissue or our elbow, throw the dirty tissue to the rubbish and then wash our hands.
- Do not touch eyes, nose or mouth without wash our hands before.
- Keep windows open and avoid stuffy places.

¿Is there any drug to prevent COVID-19?
To date, there isn’t any drug which can prevent COVID-19.

¿When to wear a mask?
We should wear a mask properly if:
-	We are out of the home where we cannot keep a distance of 6 feet or 2 meters from others (public transport, markets, streets).
-	We are at home with someone else who does not come from the same household. We should keep 6 feet away from the visitor as well.

## [masks:headSideMask] Masks (face cover)
¿What steps we must follow to wear a mask (face cover) properly? 
- Wash our hands before putting on the mask.
- Make sure of covering mouth and nose with the mask, adjust it to the nasal bone, and fast it in order to decrease spaces between the mask and the face (if the mask has ear loops, do not cross them over).
- Avoid touching the mask while we are wearing it.
- Do not wear a mask around the chin, neck, arm or wrist.
- To remove the mask, unfasten or untie the mask from behind without touching it. 
- Do not remove the mask to speak.
- Wash our hands after removing or touching the mask.
- If the mask gets wet or dirty, change it for a new and dry mask.
- We should change of mask at least every day.
- Never reuse a disposable mask. Change it for a new one after each use.
- Avoid wearing masks with exhalation valves; they cannot filter the exhaled air.
- Do not share a mask with anybody. The mask is personal.
- People at high risk to developing severe COVID-19 symptoms should wear medical  masks.

¿What could happen if I do not wear a mask (face cover) properly?
- We could selves contaminate if we touch the mask and then touch our eyes, nose and mouth without first washing our hands.
- We could selves contaminate if we do not change the mask when it gets dirty or wet.
- We could have breathing difficulty or headache if we do not choose a suitable mask. It is important to choose a mask that fits us while being able to breathe comfortably.
- If we wear a mask for a long period, it could cause skin irritation. Let’s choose a mask that doesn’t bother us.
- It could make communication difficult, especially for people with hearing difficulties. To avoid this problem, speak slowly and pronounce as clearly as possible.
- We may have a sense of false security and do not continue practicing the most important preventive measures, such as handwashing and physical distancing.
- Rubbish increment occurs if we do not dispose single use masks properly. We could avoid this by wearing a cloth mask.

¿What are the benefits of wearing a mask (face cover) properly?
- We reduce the transmission risk, avoid getting infected or spreading the virus if we are sick. 
- It decreases stigmatization (discrimination) of people who regularly have to wear a mask due to other diseases, like Tuberculosis.
- Give us a feeling that we can help in some way to stop the spreading of the COVID-19 virus.
- Make us remember that we should follow the other preventive measures, such as handwashing, do not touch our eyes/nose/mouth, physical distancing and covering mouth/face when coughing/sneezing.
- Prevent other diseases such as Tuberculosis and Influenza.
- We could have an extra income if we make reusable masks and sell them. Wearing cloth masks are cheaper and reduce the amount of rubbish generated by disposable masks.

¿What are the recommendations for the manufacture and washing of a fabric/cloth mask?
- The fabric mask requirements are: filtration (retain small drops), breathability (easy to breathe through the cloth) and fit (suit our face comfortably without adjust too much).
- Do not use elastic cloth to make the mask, as it cannot be washed with hot water as the fabric will stretch.
- Use fabric that can resist high temperatures (60°C or more).
- A cloth mask has to have at least 3 layers: 1) the inner layer that is in contact with the mouth and nose should absorb fluid, it could be of cotton or a cotton blend cloth; 2) the middle layer should not absorb fluid, it could be of polypropylene, polyester or polyaramid, and 3) the outer layer should also not absorb liquid, it could be polypropylene, polyester, or a blend of both. 
- Avoid fabric masks with exhalation valves, they cannot filter the exhaled air.
- A fabric mask should be washed at least daily.
- Do not wash cloth masks with other clothes.
- Wash cloth masks with soup/detergent and hot water (at least at 60°C). If there isn’t hot water, boil masks for 1 minute after washing them.
- Check on the mask label what is the higher temperature it could be washed. 

¿Could we wear just a face shield?
No. The face shield should always be worn with a mask or face cover.

¿Can wearing a mask for a long time cause carbon dioxide (CO2) intoxication or oxygen deficiency?
No. Wearing a mask for a long period could be annoying but it does not cause neither carbon dioxide intoxication nor oxygen deficiency. Let’s choose a comfortable mask which enabled us to breathe easily through it.

¿Should a mask be worn while doing exercise?
No. Someone who is doing exercise shouldn’t wear a mask as breathing is uncomfortable. Also, the mask gets wet with sweating making breathe even more difficult and allows microbes grow in the mask. The main measure while doing exercise is be out doors and to keep 2 or at least 1 meter apart from others.

## [rumors:users] Hearsays
There are hearsays about COVID-19 prevention that could be very harmful if we practice them. People who follow these hearsays or myths are in fact hindering the preventative measures set in place.   

¿Does fumigating houses or offices prevent COVID-19?
No. Fumigating a closed place such as house, office, health center is not recommended because it can harm people's health. To disinfect a place, it should be cleaned with water and detergent to take out the dirt first, and then, a disinfectant should be applied with a cloth enabling the disinfectant to cover all surfaces.

¿Does fumigating streets prevent COVID-19?
No. Fumigating open places such as streets or markets does not kill the COVID-19 virus. Disinfectants do not work with dirt. Moreover, when fumigate, disinfectants do not cover all surfaces to remove the virus.

¿Does fumigating or spraying people with disinfectants prevent COVID-19?
No. Fumigating or spraying people with any disinfectant do not decrease the risk of COVID-19 virus transmission. These substances can cause breathing difficulty, vomiting and skin/eyes irritation.

¿Does introducing bleach into someone prevent COVID-19?
No. Introducing bleach into the body can be dangerous and even deadly. Bleach or other disinfectant has to be used only to disinfect objects or surfaces like chairs, handles, stair handrail, floors, walls.

¿Does drinking alcohol, methanol, ethanol or bleach prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Methanol, ethanol (medical alcohol to disinfect) and bleach are harmful if they are drunk, causing even death. These substance are only to disinfect objects or surfaces, but they never to be drunk.

¿Does vaporizing eucalyptus prevent COVID-19?
There isn’t evidence that eucalyptus can kill any virus or bacteria.

¿Does cold weather kill the COVID-19 virus?
No. Cold weather with snowing doesn’t kill the COVID-19 virus. Average body temperature is around 36.5°C and 37°C whatever the temperature outside, it's irrelevant.

¿Does hot weather kill the COVID-19 virus?
No. Hot weather doesn’t kill any virus. COVID-19 transmission can increase in cold weather because people spend more time indoors with closed windows.

¿Can UV lamps disinfect hands or other body parts?
No. Ultraviolet lamp cannot disinfect any part of our body. UV rays can cause skin and eyes irritation.

¿Can hand dryers kill the COVID-19 virus?
No. Hand dryers cannot kill the coronavirus. We should wash our hands with water and soap first before drying them (using a cloth/paper towel or a warm air dryer).

¿Does taking a hot bath prevent COVID-19?
No. Bathing with very hot water can cause burns. Body temperature is around 36.5°C and 37°C whatever environmental temperature is.

¿Does eating hot pepper or spicy food prevent or cure COVID-19?
No. Chili or hot pepper can empower food taste, but they don’t prevent or cure COVID-19.

¿Does exposure to the sun or temperatures higher than 25°C prevent COVID-19?
No. Exposure to the sun doesn’t prevent COVID-19.

¿Does rinsing mouth or nose with saline prevent COVID-19?
No. Rinsing mouth or nose with saline could improve cold symptoms, but it doesn’t prevent or kill the COVID-19 virus.

¿Does eating ginger or garlic prevent COVID-19?
No. Ginger and garlic can empower our meals, but there isn’t evidence that they could prevent COVID-19.

## [vaccine:syringe] Vaccines
Vaccines are essential to protect people's health, as this aids the development and economy of the country.
In Africa, for one caregiver who could be infected and die from COVID-19 when bringing their child to be vaccinated in the health center, at least 80 child deaths are prevented due to vaccination.

¿How do vaccines work?
Vaccines train our body how to recognize and defend itself against viruses and bacteria, reducing the risk of the disease occurring.

¿Is there any vaccine to prevent COVID-19?
Yes. There are 4 vaccines with emergency approvals in different countries.

¿Can COVID-19 vaccine stop the pandemic?
COVID-19 vaccine is one of the biggest measures to stop the pandemic. However, we should continue following the other measures such as handwashing, physical distancing, covering our mouth/nose when coughing/sneezing, and wearing a mask properly.

¿What types of COVID-19 vaccines are in trials and how they work?
- Inactivated vaccines: have inactivated or weakened COVID-19 viruses that enable our bodies to produce antibodies without getting sick.
- Protein-based vaccines: have parts of the COVID-19 virus (proteins) that don’t cause the illness but make our body recognize them as foreign and enables our bodies to learn how to eliminate future infections.
- RNA and DNA vaccines: have genes of the virus that produce parts (proteins) of the COVID-19 virus. Our body destroys them and learns how to defend itself against the virus.
- Viral vector vaccines: have genes of the COVID-19 virus that are added to other weakened viruses. Our body produces a part of the virus (protein) that is recognized as foreign and then is removed.

¿Does the protection of the COVID-19 vaccine last forever?
It is unknown, more research is needed to clarify how long the protection of the COVID-19 vaccines could last.

¿How to know if COVID-19 vaccines are safe?
Much research has been conducted that looks at the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Based on the results of these studies, different countries have approved the emergency use of these vaccines. This process is very rigorous and has been done with all vaccines we use nowadays.

¿Who will be vaccinated first?
Health workers will be vaccinated first, and then, depending on each country, people who are more at risk of getting infected or developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. Children and pregnant won’t be vaccinated yet.

¿What adverse effects could cause COVID-19 vaccine?
Pain and swelling of the arm where the vaccines was shot, fever, chills, tiredness, and headache. These reactions suggest that our body is producing defenses.

¿Are COVID-19 vaccines part of a “program for mass extermination”?
No. There isn’t any program for mass extermination. Different organizations are working to keep the population as healthy as possible. The most important aim of vaccines is to be safe. This has been confirmed by conclusive research.

¿Could COVID-19 vaccines produce infertility?
No. There is too much fake news about vaccines that cause fear and distrust in people so they don’t want to get vaccinated. This fake news is quite harmful and limits preventive measures being as efficient as possible.

¿Do pneumonia vaccines prevent or protect against COVID-19?
No. Pneumonia vaccines as pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) do not protect against COVID-19 virus. COVID-19 virus needs its own vaccine. However, it is recommended to get these vaccines to prevent other forms of pneumonia.

¿Does Influenza vaccine prevent COVID-19?
No. The Influenza virus is a different virus than the COVID-19 virus, despite their symptoms are quite similar. However, it is recommended that people who recovered from COVID-19 get vaccinated against Influenza.

¿What is the benefit of diphtheria vaccination?
The benefit of diphtheria vaccination is to prevent diphtheria, and to prevent another disease from hitting us. Due to the pandemic, many children and adults who should have been vaccinated failed to do so and therefore there are vaccines available to be used.

# [home:home] WHEN THERE IS SOMEONE SICK AT HOME
¿What we should do if we have COVID-19 symptoms?
- Stay at home. We should only get out to go to the doctor or hospital.
- Seek for medical care and call a doctor as soon as symptoms begin.
- Rest and do not stress. Having good mental health is important.
- Drink water to keep hydrated.
- Stay in a separate room, with open windows.
- Use an independent bathroom, if it is possible.
- Keep windows open enabling fresh air in the house. More fresh air means fewer viruses.
- Avoid sharing common areas like the living room, dining room, kitchen. Also, when we do share a common room we should limit the amount of time we stay there.
- Practice preventive measures such as handwashing, physical distancing and covering our nose/mouth when coughing/sneezing.
- Wear a medic mask most of the time, change a mask every day. If wearing a mask is impossible, cover mouth/nose with a tissue when sneezing/coughing or speaking/laughing and then throw the dirty tissue into the rubbish.
- Avoid contaminating things or surfaces with saliva or respiratory secretions (mucus or sputum), it reduces the risk of virus transmission.
- Clean and disinfect things and surfaces we touched frequently.
- Avoid being close to animals or pets.There have been some few cases of dogs and cats infected by the COVID-19 virus because they were close to people with COVID-19.

¿What we should do if there is someone with COVID-19 at home?
- Choose a person to care for the sick one, if it is possible, this person should not be pregnant or at higher risk of developing severe coronavirus disease.
- If we care for a sick person, we could get infected and transmit the COVID-19 virus to others. It is extremely important to practice all the preventive measures such as handwashing, physical distancing, covering our mouth/nose when coughing/sneezing and always wearing mask.
- Wash hands with soap and water before and after touching the infected person. Wet wipes do not substitute handwashing.
- Stay 6 feet (2 meters) apart from the sick person.
- Do not be face to face to the sick person.
- Wear a mask when being in the bedroom of the sick person.
- Remove all things contaminated with secretions of the sick person like tissues, and then practice handwashing with soap and water.
- Keep windows open.
- Clean and disinfect things that the infected person uses or touches.

¿What disinfectants could we use against the COVID-19 virus?
- Ethanol at 70 - 90% (medical alcohol used before a shot)
- Chlorine based products (like bleach) at 0.1% for general disinfection and at 0.5% for places with blood and body secretions. 
- Hydrogen peroxide >0.5% (oxygenated water).
These substances should cover the surface for at least 1 minute to be disinfected (or depending on the maker's instructions).
